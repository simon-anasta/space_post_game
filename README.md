# space_post_game
Small pygame developed using view-model-controler
Runs in python 2.6.6
And pygame 1.9.1

Also compiled to a stand-alone executable (SpacePostService.exe). You do not require Python installed to run the executable.

Because the game writes some files during execution (it saves screenstate for each of reuse and fastest times to a log) my Anti-virus software prevented it from runing when it was saved to my Documents folder. But it ran fine when copied to a non-Documents folder.

Please let me know if you make use of this. Its always good to know. Thank you.
